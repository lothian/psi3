   * For documentation:
      ** latex
      ** latex2html (v0.99_1 or 1.62, including the patch supplied in
	  psi3/misc)

II. Basic Code Configuration, Compilation, and Installation

The following series of steps will configure and build the PSI3
package and install the executables in /usr/local/psi/bin:

   * cd $PSI3 (the top-level PSI3 source directory -- probably THIS directory)
   * mkdir objdir
   * cd objdir
   * ../configure
   * make
   * make install

You may need to make use of one or more of the following options to
the configure script:

   * --prefix=directory --- Use this option if you wish to install the
   PSI3 package somewhere other than the default directory, /usr/local/psi.

   * --with-cc=compiler --- Use this option to specify a C compiler.
   The default search order for compilers is: gcc, cc, ccc.  (NB: On AIX
   systems, the search order is cc_r,  cc,  gcc,  xlc.)

   * --with-cxx=compiler --- Use this option to specify a C++ compiler.
   The default search order for compilers is: g++, c++, cxx.  (NB: On AIX
   systems, the search order is xlC_r,  xlC,  c++,  g++.)

   * --with-fc=compiler --- Use this option to specify a Fortran-77 compiler.
   The default search order for compilers is: g77, f77, fc, f2c.  (NB:
   On AIX systems, the search order is xlf_r, xlf, g77, f77, fc, f2c.)

   * --with-blas=library --- Use this option to specify a BLAS library.
   If your BLAS library has multiple components, enclose the file list
   with single right-quotes, e.g., --with-blas='-lf77blas -latlas'.

   * --with-lapack=library --- Use this option to specify a LAPACK library.
   If your LAPACK library has multiple components, enclose the file list
   with single right-quotes, e.g., --with-lapack='-llapack -lcblas -latlas'.

   * --with-max-am-eri=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for the primitive Gaussian basis functions when computing electron
   repulsion integrals.  This is set to g-type functions (AM=5) by default.

   * --with-max-am-deriv1=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for first derivatives of the primitive Gaussian basis functions.
   This is set to f-type functions (AM=4) by default.

   * --with-max-am-deriv2=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for second derivatives of the primitive Gaussian basis functions.
   This is set to d-type functions (AM=3) by default.

   * --with-max-am-r12=integer --- Specifies the maximum angular momentum
   level for primitive Gaussian basis functions used in r_12 explicitly
   correlated methods.  This is set to f-type functions (AM=4) by default.

   * --with-debug=option --- This option turns on debugging options.
   If the argument is omitted, `` -g'' will be used by default.

   * --with-opt=options --- This option may be used to select special
   optimization flags, overriding defaults.

   * --with-parallel=sgi --- This option turns on automatic parallelization
   available with some SGI systems.  Since none of the primary developers
   of PSI3 actually uses SGI systems at present, it seems likely that this
   option will not work.

III. Detailed Installation Instructions

This section provides a more detailed explanation of the procedure for
compiling and installing the PSI3 package.

III.A. Step 1: Configuration

It is best to keep the source code separate from the compilation area,
so you must first choose a subdirectory for compilation of the codes.
A simple option is $PSI3/objdir, which should work for most environments.
However, if you need executables for several architectures, choose 
more meaningful subdirectory names.  

   * The compilation directory will be referred to as $objdir for the
   remainder of these instructions.

In $objdir, run the configure script found in the $PSI3 top-level source
directory.  This script will scan your system to locate certain libraries,
header files, etc. needed for complete compilation.  The script accepts a
number of options, all of which are listed above.  The most important of
these is the --prefix option, which selects the installation directory for
the executables, the libraries, header files, basis set data, and other
administrative files.  The default --prefix is /usr/local/psi.

   * The configure script's --prefix directory will be referred to as
   $prefix for the remainder of these instructions.

III.B. Step 2: Compilation

Running "make" (which must be GNU's 'make' utility) in $objdir will compile
the PSI3 libraries, followed by the executable modules, and finally
documentation (if LaTeX is available).

III.C. Step 3: Testing

An ever-growing number of test cases is available in $PSI3/tests.
Eventually, an automated system will be included in the package to
execute each test and compre the results to reference data.  For now ,
however, the user must run each case manually.  The PSI3 User's Manual
provides detailed instructions for running calculations.  Report bugs to
psimaster@sirius.chem.vt.edu.

III.D. Step 4: Installation

Once testing is complete, installation into $prefix is accomplished by
running "make install" in $objdir.   Executable modules are installed in
$prefix/bin, libraries in $prefix/lib, basis set data and other control
strctures $prefix/share, and documentation in $prefix/doc.

III.E. Step 5: Cleaning

All object files and libraries can be removed to save disk space by running
"make clean" in $objdir.
