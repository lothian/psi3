              PSI3: A Quantum Chemical Program Package
              ----------------------------------------

PSI3 is a suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed to compute
various molecular properties.  A few highlights of the package include:

   * Coupled cluster (CC) methods, including CCSD and CCSD(T).  
   * Determinant-based configuration interaction (CI) methods, including
   full CI and various flavors of multireference CI.
   * Integrals and derivative integrals over Gaussian functions of 
   arbitrary angular momentum (up to k-type functions have been tested).
   * Linear R12 methods, including MP2-R12.
   * Excited-state methods, including CIS(D), RPA, and EOM-CCSD.

*** SPECIAL NOTE for LaTeX2HTML users *** EFV 6/15/00 At least the
latest version of LaTeX2HTML translator (v0.99_1) has a bug in it which
prevents The Psi 3 User's and Programmer's manuals from being converted
into HTML form. Included in psi3/misc is a patch file which should be
applied directly to the latex2html script (type 'which latex2html' to
find its precise location on your system). To apply the patch just type
'patch latex2html misc/latex2html.v0.99_1.patch'. You might need superuser
privileges to do that.
