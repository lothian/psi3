*** SPECIAL NOTE for LaTeX2HTML users *** EFV 6/15/00
At least the latest version of LaTeX2HTML translator (v0.99_1) has a bug in
it which prevents The Psi 3 User's and Programmer's manuals from being
converted into HTML form. Included is a patch file which should be applied
directly to the latex2html script (type 'which latex2html' to find its precise
location on your system). To apply the patch just type
'patch latex2html latex2html.v0.99_1.patch'. You might need
superuser priviledges to do that.
