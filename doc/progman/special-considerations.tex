The following is a list of special items that should be kept in mind
while developing PSI code.

\begin{description}
\item [{\em Malloc() calls on IBM}:] The current IBM compilers (Visual Age
  C/C++ 5) do not properly prototype {\tt malloc()} unless one includes
  {\tt stdlib.h}.  Please make sure that you {\tt \#include <stdlib.h>}
  anytime you call {\tt malloc()} in a file.  If you forget, it will
  still work in gcc but not on an IBM.
\end{description}
