\section{Theoretical Methods Available in \PSIthree}

Several electronic structure methods are available in the \PSIthree\
package, from Hartree-Fock molecular orbital theory to coupled-cluster
theory to full configuration interaction.  This section introduces
the methods available and some of their most common input parameters.
Less commonly used keywords are described in the man pages for each
module.
