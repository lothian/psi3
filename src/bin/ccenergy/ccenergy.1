.SH NAME
ccenergy \- Coupled cluster singles and doubles energy program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B ccenergy
solves the coupled cluster singles and doubles amplitude equations.
This code will work for spin-restricted closed-shell Hartree-Fock
(RHF), spin-restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF), spin-unrestricted
Hartree-Fock (UHF), and Brueckner references.  The algorithm makes use of
spatial symmetry (D2h and its subgroups) and matrix algebra techniques
for efficiency.  In addition, the program can be used to simulate local
correlation methods.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
Input for this program is read from the file input.dat.  The following
keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the type of coupled cluster calculation desired.  Valid entries
at present are \fICCSD\fP, \fICCSD_T\fP, \fIBCCD\fP, and \fIBCCD_T\fP.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBREFERENCE =\fP \fIstring\fP" 
Specifies the type of orbitals used for the single-determinant
reference function.  Valied entries at present are \fIRHF\fP, \fIUHF\fP,
and \fIROHF\fP.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBMEMORY =\fP (\fIreal\fP MB)"
The maximum amount of core memory to be used, in megabytes.  See also
the \fBCACHETYPE\fP and \fBCACHELEV\fP keywords below.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Convergence desired on the CC amplitudes.  Convergence is achieved when the
RMS of the error in the CC wave function is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 7.

.IP "\fBBRUECKNER_CONV =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Convergence desired for the orbitals in Brueckner-CC calculations.
Convergence is achieved when the largest absolute value of a single T1
ampltiudes is is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 5.

.IP "\fBMAXITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Maximum number of iterations to solve the coupled cluster equations.
Defaults to 50.

.IP "\fBFREEZE_CORE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Specifes whether core orbitals should be automatically frozen in the
CC wave function.  If this option is set (preferably in the "default"
section of input), then the
.B cscf
program will identify the core orbitals.  Subsequent codes starting with
.B transqt
will freeze these orbitals.  Note that this keyword usually makes the
additional specification of FROZEN_DOCC unnecessary, but it may still be
required in some special cases.  Allowed values are true, false, yes, no,
1, 0, large and small.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation from which there will be no excitations.
The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
The default is the zero vector.
.B NB:
This keyword is actually read by the integral
transformation program
.B transqt
and the integral sorting program
.B ccsort.
See also the FREEZE_CORE keyword.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation into which there will be no excitations.
The default is the zero vector.
.B NB:
This keyword is actually read by the integral
transformation program
.B transqt
and the integral sorting program
.B ccsort.

.IP "\fBPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Determines the verbosity of the output.  A value of 0 (the default)
specifies minimal printing and a value of 2 will give output updates
as each term of the CC equations is complete.  No other values have
yet been used.

.IP "\fBNUM_AMPS =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies the number of largest T1 and T2 amplitudes to print at the end of
the CC procedure.  Default is 10.

.IP "\fBPRINT_MP2_AMPS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Indicates if the MP2 amplitudes (which are starting guesses for RHF and UHF
reference functions) should be printed.  Default is false.

.IP "\fBRESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Allows the program to use old T1 and T2 vectors from previous
calculations as the initial guesses for a new calculation.  This is
particularly useful for geometry optimizations.  The default is
\fITRUE\fP.
.B NB:
The ability to restart a calculation is also
controlled by the phases of the molecular orbitals.  If the parameter
\fBPHASE\fP from the chkpt file (cf. libchkpt) is set to \fIFALSE\fP,
then the user's \fBRESTART\fP input will be ignored.  This behavior
can be overriden, however with the \fBFORCE_RESTART\fP option.

.IP "\fBFORCE_RESTART=\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Forces possible restart of the CC equations from previous T1 and T2
amplitudes.  This option should be used only by experts.

.IP "\fBAO_BASIS=\fP \fIstring\fP"
Compute contributions from four virtual-index integrals, <ab|cd>,
from the atomic-orbital basis integrals.  This option slows
the calculation somewhat, but greatly reduces disk-space
requirements.  Allowed values are NONE (default), DISK (use the AO-basis
integrals stored on disk), or DIRECT (use
.B cints
to compute the AO-integrals on the fly in each CC iteration).  The DIRECT
option is still experimental and should be used only by experts.

.IP "\fBCACHETYPE=\fP \fIstring\fP"
Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache
used by the DPD codes.  (See libdpd.html for further details.)  A
value of \fILOW\fP (the default) selects a "low priority"
scheme in which the deletion of items from the cache is based on
pre-programmed priorities.  A value of \fILRU\fP selects a
"least recently used" scheme in which the oldest item in the cache
will be the first one deleted.

.IP "\fBCACHELEV=\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Selects the level of automatic cacheing desired in the storage of
various amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the coupled
cluster procedure.  A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while
a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache.  For
particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain
types of memory problems.  The default is 2, which means that all
four-index quantites with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g.,
<ij|ab> integrals) may be held in the cache.

.IP "\fBDIIS=\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Selects the use of the direct-inversion in the iterative subspace
(DIIS) technique of Pulay for convergence acceleration.  The default
is \fITRUE\fP.

.IP "\fBLOCAL=\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Simluate the effects of local correlation techniques.  The default is
\fIFALSE\fP.

.IP "\fBLOCAL_CUTOFF=\fP \fIreal\fP"
The tolerance value (always between one and zero) for the
Broughton-Pulay completeness check used to contruct orbital domains
for local-CC calculations.  The default is 0.02.  See J. Broughton and
P. Pulay, J. Comp. Chem. \fB14\fP, 736-740 (1993) and C. Hampel and
H.-J. Werner, J. Chem. Phys. \fB104\fP, 6286-6297 (1996).

.IP "\fBLOCAL_METHOD=\fP \fIstring\fP"
Selects the type of local-CCSD scheme to be simulated.  Valid entries
are \fIWERNER\fP for the method develop by H.-J. Werner and co-workers
or \fIAOBASIS\fP for the method developed by G.E. Scuseria and
co-workers (currently inoperative).  The default is \fIWERNER\fP.

.IP "\fBLOCAL_WEAKP=\fP \fIstring\fP"
Selects the desired treatment of "weak pairs" in the local-CCSD
method.  A value of \fINEGLECT\fP ignores weak pairs entirely.  A
value of \fINONE\fP treats weak pairs in the same manner as strong
pairs.  A value of \fIMP2\fP (the default) uses second-order
perturbation theory to correct the local-CCSD energy computed with
weak pairs ignored.

.IP "\fBPRINT_PAIR_ENERGIES =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Indicates if the MP2 and CCSD pair energies should be printed. This is only possible
for RHF references. Default is false.

.IP "\fBSPINADAPT_ENERGIES =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Indicates if spin-adapted pair energies should be printed.       
Default is false.
