<UL>
	<LI><P><B>PRINT</B> - this integer determines the amount of
	information to be printed out. Defaults to 1; 0 if <B>--fock</B> is
	specified on command-line. Print level thresholds for some
	quantities of interest may be looked up in defines.h</P>
	<LI><P><B>CUTOFF</B> - integer; 10^(-<B>CUTOFF</B>) is the cutoff on
	the integrals to be computed. Defaults value is 15 and can be
	changed by prior to compilation by editing defines.h. Keyword <B>CUTOFF</B>
	is not-used when CINTS is run in direct Hartree-Fock mode (<B>--fock</B>
	is specified).</P>
	<LI><P><B>S_FILE, T_FILE, V_FILE, ERI_FILE</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">-
	integers specifying file numbers to store overlap, kinetic energy,
	potential energy, and electron-repulsion integrals. Defaults are 35,
	36, 37, and 33.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>MEMORY</B> - number
	of double-precision words to use. Valid only in MP2 and MP2-R12
	modes. In other modes CINTS will use the minimal amount of memory
	possible. Default is 2500000 (20 MB) and can be changed by editing
	defines.h.</P>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Other keywords, such as <B>WFN</B>,
<B>REFERENCE</B>, and <B>DERTYPE</B> are also checked in certain
modes.</SPAN> It is done primarily to double-check users intentions
and to detect inconsistencies in program's input.</P>
