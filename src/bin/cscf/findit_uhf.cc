 * Revision 1.2  2002/12/06 15:50:32  crawdad
 * Changed all exit values to PSI_RETURN_SUCCESS or PSI_RETURN_FAILURE as
 * necessary.  This is new for the PSI3 execution driver.

/* Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/02/04 22:52:33  evaleev
/* Started PSI 3 repository
/*
/* Revision 1.1  1999/11/02 23:55:57  localpsi
/* Shawn Brown - (11/2/99) Modified to the code in a few major ways.
/*
/* 1.  Added the capability to do UHF.  All of the features available with the
/* other refrences have been added for UHF.
/*
/* 2.  For UHF, I had to alter the structure of file30. (See cleanup.c for a
/* map)  This entailed adding a pointer array right after the header in the SCF
/* section of file30 that pointed to all of the data for the SCF caclulation.
/* Functions were added to libfile30 to account for this and they are
/* incorporated in this code.
/*
/* 3.  Updated and fixed all of the problems associated with my previous
/* guessing code.  The code no longer uses OPENTYPE to specify the type of
/* occupation.  The keword REFERENCE and MULTP can now be used to indicate any
/* type of calculation.  (e.g. ROHF with MULTP of 1 is an open shell singlet
/* ROHF calculation)  This code was moved to occ_fun.c.  The code can also
/* guess at any multplicity in a highspin case, provided enough electrons.
/*
/* Revision 1.1.1.1  1999/04/12 16:59:26  evaleev
/* Added a version of CSCF that can work with CINTS.
/* -Ed
/*
 * Revision 1.3  1996/11/26  05:20:52  sherrill
 * Add casts in front of init_int_array() calls to avoid compiler warnings
 * (really should include libciomr everywhere instead but that causes more
 * warnings because wwritw's need casts to char *).  Also fixed problem
 * where phase() was trying to free unallocated memory.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/11/07  19:24:05  sherrill
 * Replace all initializations of integer arrays with calls to init_int_array().
 * There had been problems with using init_array() because the division by
 * the doubles-to-int factor was rounding off (integer division).
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1991/06/15  20:22:25  seidl
 * Initial revision
