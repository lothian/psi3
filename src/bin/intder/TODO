Things I need to do:
Find out what QTEST variable does (line 100 - 2)
Find out what ITST variables do
Added standalone variable to produce logic if intder is not used within PSI

immediately to do: 
modify input nocomshift so that non-reoriented center of mass is saved to checkpoint EMAIL ROLLIN
print/check center of mass shift, allow skip of COM shift
read geometry from input file geometry:() (not totally working yet)
Input/output derivatives as in YIN/YOUT/INPKFM
Haven't incorporated "ICHECK" variables into X/Y/Z IN/OUT
Also need to have some way to print the 3D/4D/5D matrices!
Need to be able to get atom labels of internal coordinates without processing the internal coordinate.
   I thought we figured out how to do this?!

SQFMC subheirarchy of keywords needs to be created

rcom/lin1 and other non-simple coordinates need to be implemented in optking

Original program read a variable NUMTEST = 'ST' to suppress numerical testing of
  individual coordinates. This should be a seperate array to since we'll be reading from into
  or PSI? ok, then these need to be passed to printinternalcoords to print coords that ARE being
  tested, so maybe need to overload printInternalCoordinates() ?
  I wrote some crap about this in transform.cc with SecondDerivative::NumTest()
