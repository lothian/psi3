.SH NAME
oeprop \- One-Electron Property Program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B oeprop
computes expectation values of one-electron property operators using
a one-particle density
matrix computed from an eigenvector in file30 or read in from an external file.
It is currently capable of performing Mulliken population analysis, 
computing electric multipole moments through octopole, 
electrostatic properties at atomic centers (electrostatic potential, 
electric field, electric field gradient, electron and spin density, dipolar anisotropic
contribution to the hyperfine coupling constants), 
electron and spin density, electron and spin density gradient,
Laplacian of electron and spin densities, electrostatic potential 
over an arbitrary two-dimensional (planar) rectangular grid,
and molecular orbitals values over an arbitrary three-dimensional
rectangular grid.
Miscellaneous capabilities include computation 
of the relativistic first-order one-electron corrections to the energy
(mass-velocity and Darwin terms), 
construction of natural molecular orbitals from one-particle density 
read from an external file (NOs can be written to file30) and 
computation of spatial
extents - expectation values of X^2, Y^2, Z^2, and R^2 operators - of
total electron density and of individual MOs (if \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPfalse)
or natural (if \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue) orbitals (\fBMPMAX\fP must be set to
a value greater than 1 for computing these entities). Spatial extents should
be used cautiously, since they depend on the reference point.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.LP
The program 
.B oeprop
is fully backward compatible with the earlier PSI property 
programs (\fBproper\fP, \fBciprop\fP, 
and \fBccprop\fP). By default \fBoeprop\fP will produce the same
information as the \fBproper\fP code.
To emulate the \fBciprop\fP and \fBccprop\fP programs,
the \fBWFN\fP keyword should be set to CI and CC respectively.
The only difference is that 
unlike the \fBciprop\fP program, \fBoeprop\fP must be run after \fBcphfci\fP 
to obtain correlation corrections to the multipole moments.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The following command-line arguments will be available in the future:
.IP "\fI-quiet\fP"
This gives the same result as \fBPRINT=0\fP.

.IP "\fI-o fname\fP"
Gives the filename for the output file.  Defaults to output.dat.

Additional input for this program is read from the file
.pN INPUT . Most of the keywords are not neccessary for routine
tasks. The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Type of the wavefunction. This keyword is a "macro" that allows user to
set most of the necessary keywords. The following values are recognized :

\fBWFN = \fPSCF - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPfalse;

\fBWFN = \fPCI  - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue, \fBOPDM_FILE = \fP40, 
\fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPAO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;

\fBWFN = \fPCCD,CCSD,CCSD_T,CCSDT1,CCSDT - equivalent to \fBEAD_OPDM = \fPtrue,
\fBOPDM_FILE = \fP79, \fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPAO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;

\fBWFN = \fPQVCCD - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue, \fBOPDM_FILE = \fP76,
\fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPSO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;


.IP "\fBREAD_OPDM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies if the one-particle density matrix to be read from disk.
Default is false.

.IP "\fBOPDM_FILE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies one-particle density matrix file number. Default is 40 (master file).
To provide backward compatibility with the earlier PSI property packages
(\fBproper\fP, \fBciprop\fP, \fBccprop\fP) special format of the density
file is assumed when \fBOPDM_FILE = 40\fP (computing properties from CI
density - \fBciprop\fP compatibility mode) and \fBOPDM_FILE = 79\fP 
(computing properties from CC density - \fBccprop\fP compatibility mode).
As of now, in generic case onepdm must be written in the very beginning of 
the file. In the future PSI will have a standard onepdm file.

.IP "\fBOPDM_BASIS =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This option may not exist in the future. As of February 1st, 1998, a standard 
for the onepdm file format has not been set. This keyword should be set to
either "SO" (read in onepdm matrix in SO basis) or "AO" (in AO
basis). Default is "SO".

.IP "\fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fP \fIstring\fP"
This option may not exist in the future. This keyword should be set to
either "TRIANG" (read in onepdm matrix in lower triangular form) of "SQUARE"
(in square form). Default is "TRIANG"

.IP "\fBASYMM_OPDM = \fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies 
whether one-particle density matrix has to be symmetrized.
Must be set to true if generic non-symmetric onepdm to be read 
(for example, from a coupled-cluster program). This keyword is for
code development only. Existing PSI CC codes now in use produce 
symmetric onepdm, therefore there is no need to use this keyword. 
Default is false.

.IP "\fBCORREL_CORR =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Flag for computing correlation corrections for electric multipole moments
using Z-vector in external file (default - file86) produced by 
.B cphfci
. Default is false.

.IP "\fBZVEC_FILE = \fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies Z-vector file number. This keyword is mostly intended for future use,
since currently \fBcphfci\fP code is hardwired to write Z-vector to file86.
Default is 86.

.IP "\fBDELETE_ZVEC =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies whether file containing Z-vector to be deleted after the
calculation or not. Default is true.

.IP "\fBROOT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This specifies which root to do the excited state analysis for.  The
appropriate one particle density matrix will be read from disk.  Currently
implemented for DETCI and DETCAS wavefunctions.

.IP "\fBMPMAX =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This integer between 1 and 3 specifies the highest electric multipole 
moment to be computed.

\fBMPMAX = \fP1 - only electric dipole moment will be computed (default);

\fBMPMAX = \fP2 - electric dipole and quadrupole moments will be computed;
\fBMPMAX = \fP3 - electric dipole, quadrupole, and octopole moments will be computed. 

.IP "\fBMP_REF\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This parameter specifies the reference point for the electric multipole
moments calculation.

\fBMP_REF = \fP0 (default) or 1 - the center of mass;

\fBMP_REF = \fP2 - the origin of the space coordinate system;

\fBMP_REF = \fP3 - the center of electronic charge;

\fBMP_REF = \fP4 - the center of nuclear charge;

\fBMP_REF = \fP5 - the center of net charge.

\fBCAUTION :\fP According to classical electrodynamics, the electric 2^(n+1)-pole 
moment is independent of the reference point only if the electric 2^(n)-pole 
moment is vanishing. It means that the dipole moment will depend on the
reference point if the total charge of the system is non-zero. By analogy,
electric quadrupole moment will depend on the reference point if the system 
possesses non-zero electric dipole moment, etc.

.IP "\fBMP_REF_XYZ =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
This vector specifies the coordinates of the reference point. If this
keyword is present in the input \fBMP_REF\fP keyword will be disregarded.

.IP "\fBNUC_ESP =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies if electrostatic properties will be computed at the
nuclei. Current list includes electrostatic potential, electric field,
electric field gradient, electron and spin density, and anisotropic
constribution to the hyperfine coupling constants (the latter two
require setting \fBSPIN_PROP\fP to true). Default is true.

.IP "\fBGRID =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies type of property to be evaluated over a grid.

\fBGRID = \fP0 (default) - compute nothing;

\fBGRID = \fP1 - electrostatic potential on a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP2 - electron density (spin density if \fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on
a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP3 - electron density gradient (spin density gradient if \fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on
a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP4 - Laplacian of the electron density (Laplacian of the spin density if 
\fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on a two-dimensional grid. According to the convention
used in the field, what actually gets plotted are the Laplacians taken with negative sign.

\fBGRID = \fP5 - values of molecular orbitals on a three-dimensional grid.

.IP "\fBMO_TO_PLOT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies the index of the molecular orbital to be plotted. It in Pitzer ordering
(ordered accoring to irreps, not eigenvalues). Ranges from 1 to the number of MOs.
Default is 1.

.IP "\fBGRID_ORIGIN =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
Specifies origin of the coordinate system associated with the grid. 
There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_UNIT_X =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
This vector specifies the direction of the x-axis of the coordinate system associated with the grid 
in terms of the unit vectors of the reference three-dimensional coordinate system.
If it is not normalized - it will be normalized by the program. There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_UNIT_Y =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
The same for the y-axis. It does not have to be neither normalized nor 
orthogonal to GRID_UNITX - it will be orthonormalized automatically.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_XY0 =\fP \fIreal_2d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the lower left corner of the grid rectangle in 
the 2D coordinate system defined by GRID_UNIT_X and GRID_UNIT_Y. 
There is no default.

the 3D coordinate system defined by orthonormalized GRID_UNIT_X, GRID_UNIT_Y, and their cross-product.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_XYZ1 =\fP \fIreal_3d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the near upper right corner of the grid box in

its Laplacian. Default is 3.0

.IP "\fBEDGRAD_LOGSCALE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Controls logarithmic scaling of the produced electron density gradient 
plot. Turns the scaling off if set to zero, otherwise the higher value - 
the stronger the gradient field will be scaled.
