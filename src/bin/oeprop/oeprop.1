.SH NAME
oeprop \- One-Electron Property Program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B oeprop
computes expectation values of one-electron property operators using
a one-particle density
matrix computed from an eigenvector in PSIF_CHKPT or read in from an external file.
It is currently capable of performing Mulliken population analysis, 
computing electric multipole moments through octopole, 
electrostatic properties at atomic centers (electrostatic potential, 
electric field, electric field gradient, electron and spin density, dipolar anisotropic
contribution to the hyperfine coupling constants), 
electron and spin density, electron and spin density gradient,
Laplacian of electron and spin densities, electrostatic potential 
over an arbitrary two-dimensional (planar) rectangular grid,
and molecular orbitals values over an arbitrary three-dimensional
rectangular grid.
Miscellaneous capabilities include computation 
of the relativistic first-order one-electron corrections to the energy
(mass-velocity and Darwin terms), 
construction of natural molecular orbitals from one-particle density 
read from an external file (NOs can be written to PSIF_CHKPT) and 
computation of spatial
extents - expectation values of X^2, Y^2, Z^2, and R^2 operators - of
total electron density and of individual MOs (if \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPfalse)
or natural (if \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue) orbitals (\fBMPMAX\fP must be set to
a value greater than 1 for computing these entities). Spatial extents should
be used cautiously, since they depend on the reference point.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP

Most of the keywords are not neccessary for routine
tasks. The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Type of the wavefunction. This keyword is a "macro" that allows user to
set most of the necessary keywords. The following values are recognized :

\fBWFN = \fPSCF - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPfalse;

\fBWFN = \fPDETCI  - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue, \fBOPDM_FILE = \fP40, 
\fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPAO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;

\fBWFN = \fPCCSD - equivalent to \fBEAD_OPDM = \fPtrue,
\fBOPDM_FILE = \fP79, \fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPAO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;

\fBWFN = \fPQVCCD - equivalent to \fBREAD_OPDM = \fPtrue, \fBOPDM_FILE = \fP76,
\fBOPDM_BASIS = \fPSO, \fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fPTRIANG;


.IP "\fBREAD_OPDM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies if the one-particle density matrix to be read from disk.
Default is false.

.IP "\fBOPDM_FILE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies one-particle density matrix file number. Default is 40 (master file).
To provide backward compatibility with the earlier PSI property packages
(\fBproper\fP, \fBciprop\fP, \fBccprop\fP) special format of the density
file is assumed when \fBOPDM_FILE = 40\fP (computing properties from CI
density - \fBciprop\fP compatibility mode) and \fBOPDM_FILE = 79\fP 
(computing properties from CC density - \fBccprop\fP compatibility mode).
As of now, in generic case onepdm must be written in the very beginning of 
the file. In the future PSI will have a standard onepdm file.

.IP "\fBOPDM_BASIS =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This option may not exist in the future. As of February 1st, 1998, a standard 
for the onepdm file format has not been set. This keyword should be set to
either "SO" (read in onepdm matrix in SO basis) or "AO" (in AO
basis). Default is "SO".

.IP "\fBOPDM_FORMAT = \fP \fIstring\fP"
This option may not exist in the future. This keyword should be set to
either "TRIANG" (read in onepdm matrix in lower triangular form) of "SQUARE"
(in square form). Default is "TRIANG"

.IP "\fBASYMM_OPDM = \fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies 
whether one-particle density matrix has to be symmetrized.
Must be set to true if generic non-symmetric onepdm to be read 
(for example, from a coupled-cluster program). This keyword is for
code development only. Existing PSI CC codes now in use produce 
symmetric onepdm, therefore there is no need to use this keyword. 
Default is false.

.IP "\fBROOT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This specifies which root to do the excited state analysis for.  The
appropriate one particle density matrix will be read from disk.  Currently
implemented for DETCI and DETCAS wavefunctions.

.IP "\fBMPMAX =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This integer between 1 and 3 specifies the highest electric multipole 
moment to be computed.

\fBMPMAX = \fP1 - only electric dipole moment will be computed (default);

\fBMPMAX = \fP2 - electric dipole and quadrupole moments will be computed;
\fBMPMAX = \fP3 - electric dipole, quadrupole, and octopole moments will be computed. 

.IP "\fBMP_REF\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This parameter specifies the reference point for the electric multipole
moments calculation.

\fBMP_REF = \fP0 (default) or 1 - the center of mass;

\fBMP_REF = \fP2 - the origin of the space coordinate system;

\fBMP_REF = \fP3 - the center of electronic charge;

\fBMP_REF = \fP4 - the center of nuclear charge;

\fBMP_REF = \fP5 - the center of net charge.

\fBCAUTION :\fP According to classical electrodynamics, the electric 2^(n+1)-pole 
moment is independent of the reference point only if the electric 2^(n)-pole 
moment is vanishing. It means that the dipole moment will depend on the
reference point if the total charge of the system is non-zero. By analogy,
electric quadrupole moment will depend on the reference point if the system 
possesses non-zero electric dipole moment, etc.

.IP "\fBMP_REF_XYZ =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
This vector specifies the coordinates of the reference point. If this
keyword is present in the input \fBMP_REF\fP keyword will be disregarded.

.IP "\fBNUC_ESP =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This flag specifies if electrostatic properties will be computed at the
nuclei. Current list includes electrostatic potential, electric field,
electric field gradient, electron and spin density, and anisotropic
constribution to the hyperfine coupling constants (the latter two
require setting \fBSPIN_PROP\fP to true). Default is true.

.IP "\fBGRID =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies type of property to be evaluated over a grid.

\fBGRID = \fP0 (default) - compute nothing;

\fBGRID = \fP1 - electrostatic potential on a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP2 - electron density (spin density if \fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on
a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP3 - electron density gradient (spin density gradient if \fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on
a two-dimensional grid;

\fBGRID = \fP4 - Laplacian of the electron density (Laplacian of the spin density if 
\fBSPIN_PROP\fP is set to true) on a two-dimensional grid. According to the convention
used in the field, what actually gets plotted are the Laplacians taken with negative sign.

\fBGRID = \fP5 - values of molecular orbitals on a three-dimensional grid.

\fBGRID = \fP6 - values of the electron density (spin density gradient if \fBSPIN_PROP\fP
is set to true) on a three-dimensional grid.

.IP "\fBGRID_FORMAT =\fP \fIstring\fP"
Specifies in which format the grid output will be produced.
Currently, \fBPLOTMTV\fP (default for 2-d grids), \fBMEGAPOVPLUS\fP (available for 3-d grids),
and \fBGAUSSCUBE\fP(default for 3-d grids) are supported.

.IP "\fBMO_TO_PLOT =\fP \fIvector\fP"
Specifies indices of the molecular orbitals to be computed on the 3-d grid. Indices can be specified
as:

unsigned integer - index in Pitzer ordering (ordered accoring to irreps, not eigenvalues).
Ranges from 1 to the number of MOs.

signed integer - index with respect to Fermi level. +1 means LUMO, +2 means
second lowest virtual orbital, -1 means HOMO, etc.

All indices have to be either unsigned or signed, you can't mix and match,
or you will get unpredictable results.
Default is to compute HOMO and LUMO.

.IP "\fBGRID_ORIGIN =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
Specifies the origin of the grid. A rectangular grid box which envelops the entire molecule
will be computed automatically if \fBGRID_ORIGIN\fP is missing, however,
there is no default for 2-d grids.

.IP "\fBGRID_UNIT_X =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
This vector specifies the direction of the first (x) side of the grid.
It doesn't have have to be of unit length.
There is no default for 2-d grids.

.IP "\fBGRID_UNIT_Y =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
The same for the second (y) side. It doesn't have to be of unit length
or even orthogonal to \fBGRID_UNIT_X\fP.
There is no default for 2-d grids.

.IP "\fBGRID_XY0 =\fP \fIreal_2d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the lower left corner of the grid rectangle in 
the 2D coordinate system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, and GRID_UNIT_Y. 
There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_XY1 =\fP \fIreal_2d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the upper right corner of the grid rectangle in 
the 2D coordinate system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, and GRID_UNIT_Y. 
There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_XYZ0 =\fP \fIreal_3d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the far lower left corner of the grid box in 
the 3D coordinate system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, GRID_UNIT_Y, and the cross-product of
the latter two. There is no default.

.IP "\fBGRID_XYZ1 =\fP \fIreal_3d_vector\fP"
Specifies the coordinates of the near upper right corner of the grid box in 
the 3D coordinate system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, GRID_UNIT_Y, and the cross-product of
the latter two. There is no default.

.IP "\fBNIX =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of grid point along x direction. This parameter has to be greater
than 1. Default is 20.

.IP "\fBNIY =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The same as \fBNIX\fP for y direction. Default is 20.

.IP "\fBNIZ =\fP \fIinteger\fP"

.IP "\fBGRID_ZMIN =\fP \fIdouble\fP"
Lower limit on displayed z-values for contour plots of electron density and 
its Laplacian. Default is 0.0

.IP "\fBGRID_ZMAX =\fP \fIdouble\fP"
Upper limit on displayed z-values for contour plots of electron density and 
its Laplacian. Default is 3.0

.IP "\fBEDGRAD_LOGSCALE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Controls logarithmic scaling of the produced electron density gradient 
plot. Turns the scaling off if set to zero, otherwise the higher value - 
the stronger the gradient field will be scaled.
Recommended value (default) is 5.

.IP "\fBSPIN_PROP =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Flag for computing spin properties (Mulliken population analysis of alpha
and beta densities, spin densities and anisotropic contributions to the
hyperfine coupling constants at atomic centers). Default is false.

.IP "\fBPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is the most important keyword - it determines amount of information
printed. The following values are currently used :

\fBPRINT = \fP0 - quiet mode - print out essential results only - "compact" results
of Mulliken population analysis, electric multipole moments, 
and electrostatic properties;

\fBPRINT = \fP1 (default) - all of the above plus list of tasks to be performed
and list of caculation parameters;

\fBPRINT = \fP2 - all of the above plus Mulliken AO population matrix and
electronic and nuclear components of electric dipole moment;

\fBPRINT = \fP3 - all of the above plus density matrix in AO basis and dipole
moment integrals in AO (and SO) basis;

\fBPRINT = \fP4 - all of the above plus basis set information, natural orbitals
in terms of symmetry orbitals, overlap matrix;

\fBPRINT >= \fP5 - all of the above plus coupling coefficient vectors, 
an occupation vector, and a modified Z-vector in MO basis.

.IP "\fBPRINT_NOS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If WRTNOS = TRUE and this option is also TRUE, the natural orbitals will
be printed to output before they are written to the checkpoint file.

.IP "\fBWRTNOS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If TRUE, the natural orbitals will be written to the checkpoint file.
