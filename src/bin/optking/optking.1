.LP NAME
optking \- geometry optimization and force constant evaluation

.LP 
\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.LP
The program
.B optking
may be used to optimize geometries in internal coordinates,
to make internal coordinate displacements, or to determine
vibrational frequencies at stationay points.  The following
sets of internal coordinates may be used:
.IP "1."
a set of internal coordinates may be provided by the user in
intco.dat.  The format is described in the \fBINTCO\fP
manpage and is the same as that used by \fBbmat\fP and \fBintder95\fP.
Only the \fBSTRE\fP, \fBBEND\fP, \fBTORS\fP, and \fBOUT\fP keywords
are currently supported by \fBoptking\fP.
.IP "2."
a redundant set of simple internal coordinates may be generated
by \fBoptking\fP based on bond-connectivity (similar to Gaussian94).
.IP "3."
a set of symmetry-adapted (limited to D2h), nonredundant, delocalized internal
coordinates can be automatically generated by \fBoptking\fP.
These coordinates may become somewhat nonorthogonal as the geometry
changes during an optimization.  The
delocalization is not yet guaranteed to successfully complete and
provide SALC's. 
.IP "4."
a set of coordinates similar to those above may be generated from
a set of simple internal coordinates provided by the user.


.LP
\fBCOMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS\fP
.LP
After internal coordinates are detected or generated, optking will
enter a run-time mode dependent on command line arguments.

.LP
Force constants are read from fconst.dat, if possible,
or else are empirically generated.  Currently, the program
has no special transition state searching methods such
as any other Hessian update besides the BFGS update.

.LP
\fBChanges of Note:\fP
.IP "1."
All information which optking uses is read from the chkpt file
(32) or optking's own psifile (1).  The only exception is that
initial force constants (if provided) are read from fconst.dat.
.IP "2."
The file intco.dat is an optional starting file.  As a result,
it will be written to by \fBoptking\fP as necessary.  The file
intco.dat should have a last line containing only ")" if you
need \fBoptking\fP to supply coordinates.

\fBINPUT FORMAT\fP
.LP

Input for this program is read from the \fBOPTKING\fP section of
the file input.dat.  The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBDISPLACEMENTS =\fP \fIvector of vectors\fP"
If
.B DISPLACMENTS
keyword is present, then a geometry optimization is not being performed,
but internal coordinate displacements are being made.  There is no default.
Each element of this vector is a vector consisting of internal coordinate
indices and displacement values.
The units of displacment are angstrom and radians.
For example, if you desire two
displacements, the first being a displacement of internal coordinate 1
by 0.01 angstroms, the second a combination of coordinate 1 displaced
by 0.01 angstroms and coordinate 2 by 0.05 angstroms, the \fBDISPLACEMENTS\fP
vector would be:
.DS
   displacements = (
     (1 0.01)
     (1 0.01 2 0.05)
   )
.DE

.IP "\fBCONV =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The test for convergence of the geometry optimization is that the
maximum force on an internal coordinate (in aJ/Ang or aJ/Rad)
must be less than 10^(-\fBCONV\fP).  The default is 5.

.IP "\fBEV_TOL =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
When primitive internals are being delocalized there must be 3n-6
(linear 3n-5) nonzero eigenvalues of the G matrix corresponding to
nonredundant delocalized coordinates.  Eigenvalues greater than
10^(-\fBEV_TOL\fP) are considered nonzero.  The default is 5.

.IP "\fBREDUNDANT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then redundant coordinates are allowed.  The default is false.

.IP "\fBDELOCALIZE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then delocalized internals are generated.
If false, then redundant primitive internals are used.
The default is true.  If the \fBSYMM\fP vector is given
by the user, this keyword has no effect.

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
In order to delocalize coordinates, character table information is
required.  For compatibility to old-input, the keyword \fBSYMMETRY\fP
is searched for in the \fBDEFAULT\fP section.  If absent, it is read
from PSIF_CHKPT (presumably successfully if input3.0 or later was used).

.IP "\fBBFGS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then a BFGS Hessian update is performed when possible.
The default is true.

.IP "\fBMIX_TYPES =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then generated delocalized coordinates will mix all primitive
internal types.  The default is true.

.IP "\fBJUNK_30 =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then the last iterated geometry from the back-tranformation to
cartesian coordinates will be written to PSIF_CHKPT, even if the back-transformation
did not converge.

.IP "\fBBONDS =\fP \fIvector of atom pairs\fP"
This array contains bonds which need to be added to the primitive
internal coordinate set.

.IP "\fBNOBONDS =\fP \fIvector of atom pairs\fP"
This array contains bonds which need to be deleted from the primitive
internal coordinate set.  

.LP
The following print options provide additional
output.  They may help the user understand the workings
of the program (The default for each is false.)

.IP "\fBPRINT_SIMPLES =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If simple internals are automatically generated, prints the related info.
.IP "\fBPRINT_PARAMS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
prints values for all of the \fBoptking\fP input parameters.
.IP "\fBPRINT_DELOCALIZE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If automatic delocalized coordinates are formed, prints the related info.
.IP "\fBPRINT_SYMMETRY =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
prints an abundance of symmetry related information.

.LP
The following keywords are parameters for the back-transformation
from internal coordinates to cartesian coordinates.  These should
rarely be needed.
.IP "\fBBT_MAX_ITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Maximum number of iterations.  Default is 100.
.IP "\fBBT_DQ_CONV =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Subsequent changes in internal coordinates must be less than
10^(-\fBBT_DQ_CONV\fP).  The default is 11.
.IP "\fBBT_DX_CONV =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Subsequent changes in cartesian coordinates must be less than
10^(-\fBBT_DX_CONV\fP).  The default is 11.
