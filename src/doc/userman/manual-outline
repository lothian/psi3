 
    o Introduction
       - what the manual hopes to accomplish
       - what PSI is
       - capabilities of the code
      [CDS: I think we can salvage some of what's there for this part]
 
    o Obtaining and Installing PSI
       - how to get PSI
       - what machines PSI works on
       - refer to installation manual
       - test cases
 
    o Simple Tutorial
       - how to set up and run something like STO-3G HF H2O ... this
         can allow us to introduce some concepts in a limited but
         practical way.  I suggest deleting the current PSI3 Tutorial
         (although maybe bits could be salvaged for other parts).
 
    o PSI Input Files
       - general considerations: syntax, rules, special characters,
         vectors, ...
       - specifying a type of calculation
         (single point, geometry optimization, frequency, ...)
       - specifying a level of theory
         (calculation type, simple version of basis input)
       - specifying a molecule
         (reference, charge, multiplicity, geometry)      
       - specifying I/O options and .psirc
 
    o SCF computations
 
    o MP2 and MP2-R12 computations
 
    o Coupled-cluster computations
 
    o CI computations
 
    o CASSCF computations
 
    o Excited state methods: CIS, RPA, EOM-CCSD
 
    o Geometry optimization and optking
 
    o Frequency analysis
 
    o One-electron properties
 
    o Customized basis sets
