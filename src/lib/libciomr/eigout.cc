** eigout(): Print out eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  
**
** Prints an n x m matrix of eigenvectors.  Under each eigenvector, 
** the corresponding elements of two arrays, b and c, will also be printed.  
** This is useful for printing, for example, the SCF eigenvectors with 
** their associated eigenvalues (orbital energies) and also the population.
**
** \param a    = matrix of eigenvectors (eigenvectors are columns)
** \param b    = first array to print under eigenvectors (e.g., eigenvalues)
** \param c    = second array to print under eigenvectors (e.g., populations)
** \param m    = number of rows in matrix a
** \param n    = number of columns in matrix a (and length of b and c)
** \param out = file pointer for output
**
** Returns: none
