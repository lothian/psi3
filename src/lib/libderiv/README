This is how to compile LIBDERIV:
1) This compilation requires some significant scratch space.  If the user
has defined the environmental variable SCRATCH, then the compilation
proceeds in $(SCRATCH)/libderiv.  Otherwise, the default location is
/tmp/$(USER)/libderiv.  You need to make sure this location has enough
disk space.

2) Type 'make' to begin compilation.  This might take awhile. Get a 
cup of tea, or go get some sun.

3) If you get any error messages - contact the author.
