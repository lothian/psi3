This is hot to compile LIBDERIV:
1) The compilation process runs in /tmp1/$(USER)/libderiv, you need to figure
out if this location is suitable for you (if you have enough disk space, in
other words).

2) If you want to use the default location for the scratch directory - just
type 'make', otherwise invoke 'make TEMP_DIR=/put/your/choice/here'. 
This might take awhile. Get a cup of tea, or go get some sun.

3) If you get any error messages - contact the author.
