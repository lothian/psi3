This is a step-by-step procedure for compiling LIBINT:

1) The compilation process runs in /tmp1/$(USER)/libint, you need to figure
out if this location is suitable for you (if you have enough disk space, in
other words).

2) Edit input.dat and modify input parameters. The following parameters are
valid:
  OLD_AM - the maximum angular momentum of functions handled by 
 the existing LIBINT times 2 (set to 0 if the library to be built 
 for the first time; if $(HOME)/psi/devel/$(ARCH)/lib/libint.a 
 already exists - check hopefully corresponding
 $(HOME)/psi/devel/include/libint.h for the value of MAX_AM, subtract one
 and double that);
  NEW_AM - the desired maximum angular momentum times 2 (see an example
 below);
  MAX_CLASS_SIZE - maximum length of Level 0 functions (if an integral class 
 contains more than MAX_CLASS_SIZE, the corresponding routine will
 be split into several smaller ones. This is done to prevent
 compiler from exhausting system resources. Defaults to 785. This should
 probably not be changed).

  *EXAMPLE*: if one wants LIBINT work for up to (gg|gg) integrals (the
 current PSI 2.0 limit), NEW_AM has to be set
 to 8 (g corresponds to l=4, (gg|gg) class will require at most the (l0|l0)
 class to be computed using Level 0 VRR routines). 
 The intended angular momentum limit for PSI 3.0 is i (l=6), 
 therefore up to (t0|t0) classes are required. NEW_AM must be set to 14.

3) If you want to use the default location for the scratch directory - just
type 'make', otherwise invoke 'make TEMP_DIR=/put/your/choice/here'. 
This might take awhile. Get a cup of tea, or go get some sun.

4) If you get any error messages - contact the author.
