This is a step-by-step procedure for compiling LIBR12:

1) This compilation requires some significant scratch space.  If the user
has defined the environmental variable SCRATCH, then the compilation
proceeds in $(SCRATCH)/libr12.  Otherwise, the default location is
/tmp/$(USER)/libr12.  You need to make sure this location has enough
disk space.

2) Edit input.dat and modify input parameters. The following parameters are
valid:
  NEW_AM - the desired maximum angular momentum times 2 (see an example
 below). In order to compile LIBR12 with NEW_AM=a, LIBINT library with
 NEW_AM >= a+2 has to be already in place.
  OPT_AM - the desired maximum angular momentum of highly optimized
 machine generated routines times 2. Past this AM level a (slower)
 generic is used.
  MAX_CLASS_SIZE - maximum length of Level 0 functions (if an integral class 
 contains more than MAX_CLASS_SIZE, the corresponding routine will
 be split into several smaller ones. This is done to prevent
 compiler from exhausting system resources. Defaults to 785. This should
 probably not be changed).

  *EXAMPLE*: if one wants LIBINT work for up to (ff|O12|ff) integrals (the
 current SORE limit), NEW_AM has to be set
 to 6 (f corresponds to l=3, (ff|O12|ff) class will require at most
 the (i0|O12|i0) class to be computed using Level 0 VRR routines). 
 The intended angular momentum limit for PSI 3 is i (l=6), 
 therefore up to (q0|O12|q0) classes are required. NEW_AM must be set to 12
 then.

3) Type 'make' to begin compilation.  This might take awhile. Get a
cup of tea, or go get some sun.

4) If you get any error messages - contact the author.
