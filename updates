09/04/03: Modified test-case MakeRules to dump its output to a top-level 
test-case-results file.   -TDC
09/05/03: Fixed a bug in dboc related to a possible reordering of shells in
basis set upon a displacement, added a few print statements, and replaced
nonstandard <iostream.h> with <iostream>.   -EFV
09/09/03: Added functions to libciomr to return input and output file names
and file prefix. DBOC uses these to set the environment for the modules
it calls using system(). cscf and other modules calling other modules need
to set the environment too! (needs to be fixed).   -EFV
09/14/03: Modified libpsio ULI macro to "unsigned long int" from "unsigned
int".   -TDC
09/16/03: Switched to malloc/free in src/bin/dboc/linalg.cc. For some reason,
IBM VisualAge C++ 5.0.2.0 doesn't release memory properly and in large CI DBOC
computations fatal memory leaks result.   -EFV
09/26/03: Added <stdlib.h> includes to a number of functions in the
libraries and corrected various warnings unearthed by "gcc -Wall".   -TDC
09/28/03: Modified installation instructions to clarify setting of maximum
angular momentum levels in libint, libderiv, etc.   -TDC
10/09/03: Corrected a number of (long int) problems in ccsort.  Added
array/matrix initialization and free routines for (long int).   -TDC
10/13/03: Modified cints/OEProp_Ints/moment_ints.c to accept a user-defined
origin.  Also corrected a bug in cints/parsing.c: I was using ip_int_array() 
rather than ip_double_array() to read the origin coords.    -TDC
10/27/03: Made sure that all temporary files are deleted between irreps
to avoid psio_errors (this includes all files generated by cceom except
RAMPS where the final R vectors are stored).  Also changed the format of
the R vectors printed to RAMPS, they are now labelled by irrep and number
of root within the irrep, e.g. "RIJAB 0 0".    -RAK
10/29/03: Fixed cclambda to work with excited states by: (1) adding 
eom_energy * lambda to RHS of lambda equations; (2) deleting intermediates 
between irreps (cclambda.c); (3) changed reading of data from cceom to 
accomodate new format like "RIJAB 0 0" and "EOM CCSD R0 0 0".   -RAK
11/07/03: Modified programmer's manual to include explanation of the CVS
branch policy and examples of cvs commands for accessing different branches.
Corrected libr12 compiler link ordering to place all object codes before
libraries to resolve symbols on IRIX systems.   -TDC
11/12/03: Documentation update in src/lib/libiwl/buf_init.c.  Corrected
install rule for tmpl.h in src/lib/libipv1.  Corrected default file prefix
values in src/lib/libciomr/psi_start.c.   -EFV
11/12/03: Corrected initialization of perturbed wave functions in local
calculations in src/bin/ccresponse/init_X.c.   -TDC
11/13/03: Numerous changes to configure.in: added --with-libs, --with-libdirs,
and --with-incdirs command-line options + updated documentation; removed many checks
for features of Fortran compiler; added checks for some standard C++ headers
not supported by some compilers (cmath, etc.) and modified relevant code to
use such headers conditionally; rewrote the check of Fortran linking convention
to remove its dependence on 'nm'. tocprint's Makefile.in is completely rewritten.
Minor cleanup of MakeVars.in in lib, bin, and util directories. Fixed typo in
libqt/lapack_intfc.c regarding DSYEV. Added support for platforms where Fortran
symbols are uppercase with underscore. Remove definition of _R in physconst.h,
it conflicts with a definition in C++ header <ctype> on OS X 10.2.8.  -EFV
