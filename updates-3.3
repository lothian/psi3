1/16/04: Added documentation for new MP2 features to the user's manual
and the man pages. -MLA

1/14/04: Added UHF and ROHF MP2 one-particle density matrices. -MLA

1/13/04: Added code 'giao' to compute B-field derivative Fock matrices.  -EFV

1/13/04: Checked in initial implementation of derivative integrals over GIAO Gaussians
necessary for optical rotation and NMR chemical shift (minus certain derivative
one-electron integrals) calculations.  -EFV

1/13/04: Added semicanonical orbitals to transqt. The reference changes from 
ROHF to UHF so I changed all the codes that "should" be affected.  Also added
UHF and ROHF MP2 energy including frozen orbitals. -MLA -TDC
