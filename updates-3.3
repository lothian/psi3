09/17/04: Added frequencies by finite differences of energies and gradients
(3- and 5-point formula) using symmetry-adapted cartesian coordinates.
Added chkpt_override_occ() to libchkpt to keep DOCC from getting parsed.
Added jobtype=FC and SYMM_FC to use internal coordinates if desired.
Added capability to do numerical, constrained optimizations.
Changed many of the test cases.  -RAK

08/12/04: Correct <S^2> computation for UHF wfns.  -TDC

07/09/04: Added UHF-based CC3 energy code, plus a test case (cc33).  This
code uses DGEMM calls, but is slow in part because it fails to limit IJK
combinations in the triples code to unique T3's.  I'll add this later, but
for now, the current version works.  -TDC

06/10/04: Added CC3 energy code to ccenergy plus a test case (cc32).  This
code stills needs conversion to a DGEMM-based version for greater
efficiency.  -TDC

06/08/04: Adding CCSD optical rotation test cases to main trunk, along with
new code for velocity-gauge dipole-based optical rotation for
origin-independent results. -TDC

05/03/04: Merged code from psi-3-2-1 into main trunk. Fixed a number of
small bugs arising from the merge.  -TDC

4/26/04: Standardized naming of cchbar matrix elements Wmnie and Wamef.  Spin-
adapted computation of the Xi amplitudes in ccdensity for RHF references.
Added test cases for all types of EOM gradients. -RAK

3/19/04: Finished bulk of spin-adaptation of cchbar codes, including the
Wmbij and Wabei terms, which are by far the worst.  This version should use
considerably less disk space and be 2-3 times faster than the psi-3.2
version of cchbar.  -TDC

3/17/04: Substantial modifications to cchbar, cclambda, cceom, and 
ccresponse to take advantage of RHF spin-adaptation.  Also eliminated
several redundant storage arrangements of Wamef elements. Added an
ROHF-EOM-CCSD test case, cc22.  -TDC

3/17/04: Modified DBOC code to take into account symmetry of the molecule
as much as possible to reduce the number of wave function computations. -EFV

3/16/04: Finished modifications to DBOC to allow 4-point formula for derivative
wave functions. 4-point results seem much more accurate and independent of
the displacement size. -EFV

3/15/04: Started reorganization of DBOC code to allow for 4-point gradient formula.
Currently the code works again for 2-point displacements. -EFV

3/10/04: Corrections: (1) fixed ccresponse for new storage of lambda
amplitudes; (2) added cc21 test case to tests/Makefile.in and configure.in.
-TDC

3/2/04: Added new EOM-CCSD gradient code, including test case cc21. -RAK

1/26/04: Fixed a bug in src/lib/libdpd/contract444.c for out-of-core cases.
I was not including the size of a single file4 row on the X component of
the X*Y-->Z contraction, which is necessary for some <ab|cd> cases in
cclambda.  This fix also appears on the psi-3-2 branch. -TDC

1/16/04: Added documentation for new MP2 features to the user's manual
and the man pages. -MLA

1/14/04: Added UHF and ROHF MP2 one-particle density matrices. -MLA

1/13/04: Added code 'giao' to compute B-field derivative Fock matrices.  -EFV

1/13/04: Checked in initial implementation of derivative integrals over GIAO Gaussians
necessary for optical rotation and NMR chemical shift (minus certain derivative
one-electron integrals) calculations.  -EFV

1/13/04: Added semicanonical orbitals to transqt. The reference changes from 
ROHF to UHF so I changed all the codes that "should" be affected.  Also added
UHF and ROHF MP2 energy including frozen orbitals. -MLA -TDC
