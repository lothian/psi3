3/16/04: Finished modifications to DBOC to allow 4-point formula for derivative
wave functions. 4-point results seem much more accurate and independent of
the displacement size. -EFV

3/15/04: Started reorganization of DBOC code to allow for 4-point gradient formula.
Currently the code works again for 2-point displacements. -EFV

3/10/04: Corrections: (1) fixed ccresponse for new storage of lambda
amplitudes; (2) added cc21 test case to tests/Makefile.in and configure.in.
-TDC

3/2/04: Added new EOM-CCSD gradient code, including test case cc21. -RAK

1/26/04: Fixed a bug in src/lib/libdpd/contract444.c for out-of-core cases.
I was not including the size of a single file4 row on the X component of
the X*Y-->Z contraction, which is necessary for some <ab|cd> cases in
cclambda.  This fix also appears on the psi-3-2 branch. -TDC

1/16/04: Added documentation for new MP2 features to the user's manual
and the man pages. -MLA

1/14/04: Added UHF and ROHF MP2 one-particle density matrices. -MLA

1/13/04: Added code 'giao' to compute B-field derivative Fock matrices.  -EFV

1/13/04: Checked in initial implementation of derivative integrals over GIAO Gaussians
necessary for optical rotation and NMR chemical shift (minus certain derivative
one-electron integrals) calculations.  -EFV

1/13/04: Added semicanonical orbitals to transqt. The reference changes from 
ROHF to UHF so I changed all the codes that "should" be affected.  Also added
UHF and ROHF MP2 energy including frozen orbitals. -MLA -TDC
