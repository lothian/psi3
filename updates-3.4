08/02/07 Libpsio is now fully object-oriented. The current C-style interface is
unchanged. Only the default single instance of the library can be accessed and
configured from C programs in Psi3. Multiple instances of the library
can now be created and configured from any C++ program without the need
to use any Psi3-specific facilities, such as libipv1, etc.  -EFV

08/01/07 Doxygen file and group stubs have been added to all source
code files in src/bin and src/lib. In addition, a generic brief
description of each file ("Enter brief description of file here") has
been added. Please change this description when you are working on a
file. misc/psi3.dox has been modified to include src/bin and .cc files
in the doxygen documentation.  -Steve Arnstein

04/12/07  Added rules to doc/MakeRules.in to generate both sectioned and
single-page HTML versions of the manuals.  -TDC
