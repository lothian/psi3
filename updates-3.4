09/06/07 Psirb can now be used in an interactive mode. To use type
"psirb -I". -JMT

09/05/07 Psirb can now read in the z-matrix from checkpoint. This is used
in the Ruby driver for optking. When a geometry optimization completes
either successfully or runs out of cycles the new z-matrix is read in and
the Psi::zmat variable is updated with the new geometry. Also added
ability to use variables in the zmat variable, the variables are updated
as well. See the wiki for an example of this. -JMT

09/05/07 CSCF can now reset occupations during SCF if RESET_OCCUPATIONS is
is set to true.  -EFV

08/20/07 More efficient formulas are now used to compute frequencies by
finite differences of energies (both "3-point" and "5-point"), significantly
reducing the number of displacements required. -RAK

08/20/07 The capability to use special Euler angle interfragment coordinates
has been added. -RAK

08/17/07 Modified optking to print imaginary vibrational frequencies
correctly in freq_grad.cc.  -TDC

08/14/07 Psirb now handles frequency calculations via second derivatives and
finite displacements of gradients and energy points. -JMT

08/13/07 Additional functionality has been added to psirb. Includes support for
mp2, detci, and modules needed to compute gradients for both HF and CC. An 
interface to optking for geometry optimization is included. The optking interface
is able to determine if analytic gradients are available for a given level of 
theory and use them, otherwise gradients by energy points are performed. If the 
user freezes core orbitals they will need to tell the optking interface to use 
energy points. Four test cases are included, they are prefixed with rb. -JMT

08/13/07 Psi3 can be configured to follow CCA integrals standard outlined in
an upcoming paper by Kenny et al. (the ordering of spherical harmonics
is not yet determined). UPDATE (08/20/07): the native Psi3 ordering of spherical
harmonics is the same as CCA ordering. UPDATE (08/29/07): in violation of the
reasonable behavior, Psi assumed that if # of AO == # of SO, then no spherical
harmonics were used. Changed Psi to respect puream input. Whether cartesian or spherical harmonics are used is now stored in the checkpoint file. -EFV

08/07/07 Libchkpt is now fully object-oriented. The current C-style interface is
unchanged. Only the default single instance of the library can be accessed and
configured from C programs in Psi3. Multiple instances of the library can now
be created and configured any C++ program given that you use the C++ version of
libpsio. -JMT

08/04/07 The new Psi driver is now in the repository. This version provides the
same functionality as was shown at the Psi3 workshop at UGA. It was modified to
make use of the C++ libpsio. A manual is in the works for the new driver. Until
a manual is available please refer to the wiki. -JMT

08/02/07 Libpsio is now fully object-oriented. The current C-style interface is
unchanged. Only the default single instance of the library can be accessed and
configured from C programs in Psi3. Multiple instances of the library
can now be created and configured from any C++ program without the need
to use any Psi3-specific facilities, such as libipv1, etc.  -EFV

08/02/07 Bug fixes: (1) ccenergy: corrected un-closed libchkpt in Brueckner 
code; (2) Initialized counter in ccdensity rho_params setup.  -TDC

08/01/07 Doxygen file and group stubs have been added to all source
code files in src/bin and src/lib. In addition, a generic brief
description of each file ("Enter brief description of file here") has
been added. Please change this description when you are working on a
file. misc/psi3.dox has been modified to include src/bin and .cc files
in the doxygen documentation.  -Steve Arnstein

04/12/07  Added rules to doc/MakeRules.in to generate both sectioned and
single-page HTML versions of the manuals.  -TDC
