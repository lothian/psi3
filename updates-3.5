8/24/09 Added many RI basis sets to pbasis.dat - JMT

8/22/09 Added DF-MP2 code -CDS, JMT, ACS, EGH

8/22/09 Modified libchkpt to handle multiple basis sets -JMT, CDS

8/22/09 Added CI gradients (won't work with frozen virtuals yet) -CDS

05/11/09 libmints can now compute integrals with a different basis set
on each center. Additional basis sets can be read in from different
chkpt files or from a GENBAS file. If using GENBAS, the BasisSet
object will not use symmetry. Added static function to BasisSet to
create a basis object [zero_basis_set()], that can be used with the
ERI object to compute 3-center integrals. -JMT

02/25/09 Added MP2-CCSD tests and minor changes to moinfo. -FAE
